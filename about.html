              I use a variety of styles, colours and techniques in my paintings.
              I find my inspiration from family life, travelling, world events
              and life experiences. The beauty in this world that God has
              created is my muse, whether it be through the human life, nature
              or experiences.

              I aspire to create work that is expressive and emotive at the same
              time fun, exciting and colourful. I love creating paintings that
              will bring a message of love, joy, hope and peace to the viewer. I
              also aspire to inspire viewers to create something for themselves.
              I can design, draw, paint and create any idea but what I enjoy the
              most and specialize in is painting. Whilst I was trained to work
              with oil paints and love working with this medium, my most common
              medium is acrylic paint because they dry faster and this was an
              easier medium to use with little kids running around who wanted to
              touch paintings! My art career has led me to paint abstracts,
              landscapes, portraits and whatever my client envisions.

              My name is Alice, most people call me Alice, but some call me
              Alissimo, Allie, Ally Pally and Pal and even Alison. I was born
              and raised in Surrey, England, as one of 5 siblings, from loving
              Mauritian parents who would tell us about the amazing and
              beautiful island of Mauritius. Perhaps that’s why I ended up on an
              island myself.

              My husband and I now live in Bermuda with our three amazing
              children, Tai, Jaime and Cruz. By day I work fulltime at an
              Insurance Company and by night my creativity is explored! With all
              the challenges that life brings and the many hats I have to wear,
              every day is filled with challenges, opportunities and adventures.

              Since I was a child I’ve always loved to draw and paint and my
              hobby has led me to where I am today. I would draw at church, on
              the bus, at home, and sometimes on the desks at school, until I
              got found out! Even when I didn’t have the tools to draw I would
              look at scenes calculating in my mind how and where the lines
              connect. Although I don’t always have the time to explore every
              idea floating in my mind, from the time I wake up in the morning
              to the time I go to sleep I find myself dreaming about the next
              painting.

              When I first came to Bermuda I was mesmerized by Bermuda’s scenery
              and started to paint in my spare time. I volunteered at
              Masterworks to help with other artists exhibitions and it gave me
              the idea to have my own exhibition.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-14">
              I was hooked after that! Now today, I am a well known and
              respected artist in Bermuda and I have exhibited at most of the
              prestigious art galleries in Bermuda. I have entered many
              competitions and won various awards. People enjoy my artwork all
              around the world which encourages me to paint more and make my
              artwork more accessible across the globe.

              Living through these changing times has forced me to ask myself
              what is my vision, my purpose and why has God given me this talent
              and have I been hiding it for too long. I came to the conclusion
              that there is no better time than now. I am an artist and always
              will be. I believe God has given me this talent for a reason and I
              know I have to use it to further His work. “In all your ways
              acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths”. Proverbs 3:6. My
              purpose is to utilize my talent to illustrate and capture the
              beauty of the world He has created for us and to give hope and joy
              through my paintings.
